## Our Design Process
We took inspiration from noteTaker. We chose to use colors that were fresh and inviting to our users. We created a mock-up design on Figma.

Our deployed version is a much cleaner version of our mock-up. We wanted to make it clear to where all the actions happen. Here is a GIF file of our entire project.

## Future Directions
We have some ideas for the future of GroGroGro. We want to get our MultiMember Feature fully functional. This feature allows users to invite memebers to edit and write on list.We also want to attach photos next to the item listed and implement the abilty to scratch an item off.  Lastly, we want to add a feature to share list with members outside the home too
